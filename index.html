                <td>Trapper doesn't exactly have a "power" or ability of his own, he carries and places bear traps accross the map. They're very situational and depend on the map along with taking an insane amount of skill. However with the right add-ons and map, he can be quite powerful in terms of map control.</td>

                <td>Nurse possesses a very powerful "blink" ability, being able to teleport large distances. This comes at the cost of being the slowest killer and being unable to see how far forward she will teleport. All these drawbacks give her one of the highest skill ceilings in the game. However, once learning and mastering her blink ability she is vitually unstoppable.</td>

                <td>Sitting at a skill ceiling close to Nurse, Spirit has the ability to enter a "phase walk" state. This state allows her to traverse the map unseen at the cost of her ability to see the survivors. Spirit relies on sutble movements of the environment and sense of hearing to sneak up on her victims undetcted.</td>

                <td>Pyramid Head has a big presence on the map and dominates with the power "Rites of Judgement". Using this power creates a trail of barbed wire in the gound as he walks. If a survivor walks through any of the wire, they become "damned" and are signalled by a heartbeat to PHead. This heartbeat is called "Killer Instinct". A damned survivor is capable of being sent to a "Cage of Attonement" rather than carrying the survivor to a hook. If a damned survivor has already been brought to the second hook stage previously, PHead can quickly kill them by his own hand. He can also use a mid-ranged linear attack from the ground that passes through walls called "Punishment of the Damned".</td>

                <td>Springtrap easily controls the map with the help of his security doors scattered accross the map. He can travel door to door and once exitting from the door he travels to, he becomes undetectable, allowing him to sneak up on his victims. The survivors are also able to use these doors, either to reveal Springtrap for a certain period of time with the use of the cameras or travel through the doors themselves. If Springtrap is also going through the door with them, he catches them and exits the door carrying the survivor. He weilds a fire axe as his power which he can throw at survivors, leaving the axe in the survivors shoulder until they remove it themself or Springtrap recalls the axe back to him. Once in range, Springtrap can pick up the survivor from the axe</td>

                <td>Hillbilly carries a chainsaw in which he uses to sprint accross the map with ease. While sprinting, he can turn initially but its greatly decreased after the start-up. This chainsaw can instantly down a survivor no matter their health state. Once the chainsaw has been used a good amount, it becomes nitro fueled. The nitro fuel allows Billy to turn for longer at the start-up of the sprint and turn slightly easier during the sprint.</td>

                <td>Oni is a demon who channels the blood of his victims into power with the use of "Blood Fury". He injures survivors to make them drop orbs of blood he can absorb to charge his fury. Once full, he gains a speed increase until he activates the power. When its activated he can dash accross the map with "Demon Dash" and instantly down any survivor he hits. His other attack "Demon Strike" works as a very drawn out lunge which also instantly downs any survivors.</td>
