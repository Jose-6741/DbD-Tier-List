This power gives him the ability to use his sword to rip into the<br>gound as he walks, leaving behind a trail on barbed wire. If a survivor wanders through any of the wire<br>they become "damned" and are signalled by a heartbeat to PHead, this heartbeat is called "Killer Instinct"<br>A damned survivor is capable of being sent to a "Cage of Attonement" instantaneously rather than carrying the<br> survivor to a hook. If a damned survivor has already been brought to the second hook stage previously, PHead<br>can quickly kill them by his own hand. PHead is also able to use his power to create a<br>mid-ranged linear attack from the ground that passes through walls called "Punishment of the Damned".</td>

The survivors are also able to use these<br>doors, either to reveal Springtrap for a certain period of time with the use of the<br>cameras or travel through the doors themselves. However if Springtrap is also travelling through<br>the door with them, he catches them and exits the door carrying the survivor he finds.<br>He weilds a fire axe as his power which he can throw at survivors, leaving the axe in the survivors shoulder until they<br>remove it themself or Springtrap recalls the axe back to him. Once in a certain range, Springtrap<br>can grab the axe from the survivor himself and pick the survivor up that way.</td>
